## 📝 How to Use

First, you need a Roblox executor of your choice.
(The script was texted with [Xeno](https://xeno.onl/download) executor.)

When you have it, open Roblox and then join the game of your choice and attach the executor to your Roblox.
After the script is attached you need to execute this following script below;

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asteroidlordfr/Chroma/refs/heads/main/Source/Chroma.lua'))()
```

Afterwards, you will have Chroma!
You can toggle the UI with ``K``

## 🔎 Troubleshooting

- Can't attach my executor to Roblox
   - Try reopening your executor, and also make sure you are using the [direct download version of Roblox](https://roblox.com/download) instead of the Microsoft Store version.
 
- Keep getting teleported back after using a speed module
   - Try lowering your speed amount as this is likely ping or an anticheat interfering.
